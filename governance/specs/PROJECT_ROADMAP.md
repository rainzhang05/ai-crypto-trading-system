# AI CRYPTO TRADING SYSTEM — MASTER PROJECT ROADMAP
Version: 1.0  
Status: Authoritative Execution Roadmap  
Scope: From Deterministic Core Hardening → Production Deployment

# 0. PROJECT OBJECTIVE

Build a production-grade, deterministic, auditable AI crypto trading system with:

- Full deterministic replay
- Hash-perfect lineage
- Strict capital preservation
- Append-only financial ledger
- Walk-forward validated models
