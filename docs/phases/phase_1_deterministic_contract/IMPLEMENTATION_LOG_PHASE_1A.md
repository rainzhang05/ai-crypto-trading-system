# IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_PHASE_1A

## Scope
Phase 1A integrity-hardening design closure evidence (design phase, no direct executable migration in this artifact).

## Authoritative References
- `docs/specs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` (Phase 1A marked completed)
- `docs/specs/ARCHITECT_DECISIONS.md` (deterministic-contract rationale and approval path)
- `docs/specs/MASTER_SPEC.md` (Phase 1A/1B/1C completion statements)

## Deliverable Mapping
- Phase 1A outputs are represented as governance design decisions and contract definitions that fed Phase 1B migration blueprint.
- No standalone Phase 1A SQL migration file is recorded as canonical executable input for new environments.

## Status
- Phase 1A is documented as complete and superseded by implemented Phase 1B/1C executable contract state.
