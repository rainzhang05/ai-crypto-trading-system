> Historical Artifact Notice
> This file records Phase 0-2 migration or implementation history and may contain then-active baseline defaults (for example hour-bucketed state, 10/20%/8% limits, and phase-locked constraints).

# IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_PHASE_1B

## Scope
Phase 1B deterministic-contract schema migration blueprint closure evidence.

## Authoritative References
- `docs/phases/phase_1_deterministic_contract/SCHEMA_MIGRATION_PHASE_1B.md`
- `docs/specs/ARCHITECT_DECISIONS.md` (ARCH-0002 approval)
- `docs/specs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` (Phase 1B marked completed)

## Blueprint-to-Execution Linkage
- Phase 1B defines the authoritative ordered migration blueprint.
- Phase 1C implementation log captures execution outcomes against this blueprint, including Revision B/C closure:
  - `docs/phases/phase_1_deterministic_contract/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_PHASE_1C.md`

## Status
- Phase 1B blueprint approved and closed; implementation state realized through Phase 1C Revision B/C and canonicalized in `schema_bootstrap.sql`.
