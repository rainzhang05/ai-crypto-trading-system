# Phases Directory Policy

This directory contains historical phase artifacts (migration blueprints, implementation logs, completion reports) for Phase 0-2.

Important interpretation rule:

- These artifacts preserve point-in-time baseline constraints and implementation context.
- They are not the primary source for current strategy/risk behavior in new implementation work.

Current authoritative implementation policy is defined in:

- `docs/specs/TRADING_LOGIC_EXECUTION_SPEC.md`
- `docs/specs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `docs/specs/RISK_RULES.md`
- `docs/specs/MASTER_SPEC.md`
- `docs/specs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`
